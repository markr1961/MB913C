- link to this project https://github.com/markr1961/MB913C

Examples and template project for ST's STM32VLDISCOVERY (MB913C) dev board.  
Project, code and libraries are cira 2010.  
Originally created for STM32F103R6 using IAR v5, includes STM32F10x StdPeriph Driver of unknown age.  
Some of these boards appear to have STM32F103R6, while some have STM32F100R6.  
Really out of date at this point, but archived here because the information is hard to find.  

Needs work to build with IAR v7.4.

Most of the code and files are COPYRIGHT 2010 STMicroelectronics.

- 8M Hz HSE crystal (X2)
- 32KHz LSE crystal (X3)
- Push buttons: B1( USER), B2 (RST)
- 2 LEDs: LD3,LD4
